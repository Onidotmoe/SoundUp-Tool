# SoundUp-Tool
 Old WPF app written in VB.Net. It's made as a modding tool for Command & Conquer : Tiberian Sun.

 It takes .xml files and injects them into .ini files as those were a hassle to work with at the time, was originally intended to work only for the sound files but can be used for any other .ini files too.
 
 Note that any stuff related to "Command & Conquer" and anything else that i didn't make is owned by their respective parties.
